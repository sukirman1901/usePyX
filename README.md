PyX is a next-generation, full-stack framework designed for Python developers who need performance, simplicity, and a modern user experience. PyX eliminates the need for JavaScript by handling the entire application lifecycle—from reactive UI to database persistence—all within the Python ecosystem.

3. Key Features (Daftar Poin Utama)
Gunakan bullet points ini untuk menyoroti keunggulan PyX:

⚡ Core Engine & Performance
Pure Python, Rust Power: Write 100% Python code while leveraging the speed and concurrency of a Rust-based (Granian) engine for server operations.

Real-time by Design: Built on WebSockets for seamless, automatic data synchronization between the server and the browser, eliminating complex AJAX/API calls.

🎨 Developer Experience (DX)
Zen Mode UI: Create beautiful, complex layouts using an intuitive, linear Python syntax (with ui.row():) instead of confusing nested functions or HTML templates.

Zero JavaScript Needed: Handle all UI interactions, styling, and event handling directly in Python.

Fluent Styling: Use method chaining (e.g., .bg("blue-600").hover("scale-105")) to apply full Tailwind CSS power without writing a single CSS file.

🏗️ Architecture & Structure
Modular Reactive MVC: Enforces a clean, scalable project structure where features are organized into modules (modules/auth/, modules/data/).

Stateful Controllers: Controllers retain state across user interactions, enabling simpler live application logic compared to stateless frameworks like Laravel.

SQLModel Integration: Provides a type-safe, clean API for database interactions, reducing boilerplate code and preventing common errors.
